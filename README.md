# Minor Project
The main motivation of doing this research is to present a heart disease prediction model for the prediction of occurrence of heart disease. Further, this research work 
is aimed towards identifying the best classification algorithm for identifying the possibility of heart disease in a patient. This work is justified by performing a 
comparative study and analysis using classification algorithms. 
A set of ML algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), NAVIE BAYES (NB), RANDOM FOREST, and LOGISTIC REGRESSION will be deployed 
for the prediction of corona virus disease followed by performance evaluation and analysis of the chosen algorithms to identify the optimal technique with the 
highest accuracy.
