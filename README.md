Machine Learning Project:
The main motivation for doing this research is to present a heart disease prediction model for predicting the occurrence of heart disease. Further, this research work It 
is aimed towards identifying the best classification algorithm for identifying the possibility of heart disease in a patient. This work is justified by performing a 
Comparative study and analysis using classification algorithms. 
A set of ML algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), NAIVE BAYES (NB), RANDOM FOREST, and LOGISTIC REGRESSION, will be deployed 
for the prediction of heart disease, followed by performance evaluation and analysis of the chosen algorithms to identify the optimal technique with the 
highest accuracy.
